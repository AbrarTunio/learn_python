When an object has a value that is not what you expected, it can be difficult to track down exactly where in the code it was set. Wherever it is practical to do so, it is best to avoid side effects. The way to avoid using side effects is to use return values instead.\n",

    "You can use the same coding pattern to avoid confusing side effects with sharing of **mutable objects**. To do that, explicitly make a **copy of an object** and pass the copy in to the function. Then return the modified copy and reassign it to the original variable if you want to save the changes. The built-in **list function**, which takes a sequence as a parameter and returns a new list, works to copy an existing list. For dictionaries, you can similarly call the **dict function**, passing in a dictionary to get a copy of the dictionary back as a return value."
